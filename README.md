## Technical Requirements

### Hardware
- MCB1700 Development Board
- LCD Display
- Joystick
- Potentiometer
- LED Array
- USB Connection (for MP3 player)

### Software
- Keil uVision IDE
- GIMP (for image processing)
- C Programming Language

## Development Notes

- Images are converted to .c files using GIMP and implemented using GLCD_Bitmap
- Audio streaming uses interrupt-based USB communication
- Game logic is modularized for easy maintenance
- Menu system uses state-based navigation
- All graphics rendered using the GLCD library
